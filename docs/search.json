    "section": "Basic data structures in R",
    "text": "Basic data structures in R\nBefore we work with real data, we should first recap important data structures in R\nA single value (type does not matter) is called a scalar (it is just one value):\n\na = 5\nprint(a)\n## [1] 5\n\nthis_letter = \"A\"\nprint(this_letter)\n## [1] \"A\"\n\n\n\n&lt;- and = are assignment operators, they are equivalent and are used to assign values, data, or objects to a variable.\nIn R you can use any type of name for a variable, you can even mix numbers and dots in the name: test5 or test.5, but there is one restriction, no special symbols (as they are usually operators or functions) and a name cannot start with a number, for example 5test will throw an error.\nHowever, usually we want to assign several values to a variable. For example, a dataset consists of several columns (=variables). We can use the function c(...) to connect (or concatenate) several values:\n\nage = c(20, 50, 30, 70)\nprint(age)\n## [1] 20 50 30 70\nnames = c(\"Anna\", \"Daniel\", \"Martin\", \"Laura\")\nprint(names)\n## [1] \"Anna\"   \"Daniel\" \"Martin\" \"Laura\"\n\n\nVectors\n\n\nYou can only concatenate values from the same data type! If they are different, all will be casted to the same data type!\n\nprint(c(\"Age\", 5, TRUE))\n## [1] \"Age\"  \"5\"    \"TRUE\"\n\nThe c(...) function returns a vector which is a one-dimensional array. You can access elements of the vector by using the square brackets [which_element]:\n\nage[2] # second element\n## [1] 50\nage[1] # first element\n## [1] 20\n\nThis is known as indexing. And there are a few tricks:\n\nUse [-n] to return all elements except for n:\n\nage[-2] # return all except for the second element\n## [1] 20 30 70\n\nUse another vector to return several elements at once:\n\nage[c(1, 3)] # return first and third elements\n## [1] 20 30\nage[-c(1,3)] # return all elements except for first and third elements\n## [1] 50 70\n\nUse &lt;- or = to re-assign/change elements in your vector\n\nage[2] = 99\nprint(age)\n## [1] 20 99 30 70\n\n\n\n\nThe : operator in R is not the division operator. It actually creates a range of integer values with start:end:\n\n1:5\n## [1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nWhich is really useful for indexing:\n\nage[1:3]\n## [1] 20 99 30\n\n\n\nMatrix\nUsually a dataset consist not of only one variable/vector but of several variables (columns) and observations (rows), for example:\n\nage = c(20, 30, 32, 40)\nweight = c(60, 70, 72, 80)\n\nwe can use higher order data structures to combine these variables in a two dimensional array (like we would, for example, do in excel) using the matrix(...) function:\n\ndataset = matrix(NA, 4, 2)\ndataset # empty dataset\n##      [,1] [,2]\n## [1,]   NA   NA\n## [2,]   NA   NA\n## [3,]   NA   NA\n## [4,]   NA   NA\ndataset[,1] = age\ndataset[,2] = weight\ndataset\n##      [,1] [,2]\n## [1,]   20   60\n## [2,]   30   70\n## [3,]   32   72\n## [4,]   40   80\n\nSimilar to a vector we can index certain elements in the matrix or at the same time entire rows or columns. Since is has now two dimensions, we change [i] to [row_i, col_j]. The first argument specifies which row and the second argument which column should be returned. There are again a few handy tricks, above we left the rows empty (dataset[,1]) which will R interpret as “use all rows”, in that way we can print/return entire columns or rows:\n\ndataset[,1] # first column\n## [1] 20 30 32 40\ndataset[1,] # first row\n## [1] 20 60\n\n\n\nDon’t worry, you don’t have to create your own data sets like we did in this section. When you import your data into R, it is automatically returned as a matrix (or as data.frame, see below).\nA limitation of the matrix() is that is can only consist of one data type (like the vectors), if we mix the data types, all will be cast to the same data type:\n\ncbind(age, names)\n##      age  names   \n## [1,] \"20\" \"Anna\"  \n## [2,] \"30\" \"Daniel\"\n## [3,] \"32\" \"Martin\"\n## [4,] \"40\" \"Laura\"\n\n\n\ncbind() is a function that combines columns (“column binds”), it can be used as a shortcut to create a matrix from several vectors. Another important command is rbind(...) which combines vectors (or matrices) over their rows:\n\nrbind(age, names)\n##       [,1]   [,2]     [,3]     [,4]   \n## age   \"20\"   \"30\"     \"32\"     \"40\"   \n## names \"Anna\" \"Daniel\" \"Martin\" \"Laura\"\n\n\n\nData.frames\nThe data.frame() can handle variables with different data types. Data.frames are similar to matrices, they are two dimensional and the indexing is the same:\n\ndf = data.frame(age, names, weight)\ndf\n##   age  names weight\n## 1  20   Anna     60\n## 2  30 Daniel     70\n## 3  32 Martin     72\n## 4  40  Laura     80\nstr(df)\n## 'data.frame':    4 obs. of  3 variables:\n##  $ age   : num  20 30 32 40\n##  $ names : chr  \"Anna\" \"Daniel\" \"Martin\" \"Laura\"\n##  $ weight: num  60 70 72 80\n\n(we will talk below more about data.frames)"

    "section": "Bonus - Advanced programming",
    "text": "Bonus - Advanced programming\nUntil now we have only learned how to use functions and indexing of data structures. But what are functions?\n\nFunctions\nA functions are self contained blocks of code that do something, for example, the average of a vector is given by:\n\\[\nAverage = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\n\\]\nIn R we can easily calculate the sum over a vector by using the function sum():\n\nvalues = 1:10\nprint(values)\n##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n# Average \nsum(values)/length(values)\n## [1] 5.5\n\nTo do that now more easily and in a comprehensive way for many different variables, we can define a function to calculate the mean:\n\naverage = function(x) {\n  average = sum(x)/length(x)\n  return(average)\n}\naverage(values)\n## [1] 5.5\n\nA function consists of: - An expressive name - Arguments function(arg1, arg2, arg3), the arguments can be used to pass the data to the function, or to change the behaviour of the function (see below) - A function body, inside curly brackets { } where the actual magic happens - return(...) what should be returned from the function\nThe advantages: - you can compress big code blocks within one function call - reproducibility, we avoid writing the same code again and again, if we want to change the way how we calculate the average, we have to change it only in one place - clarity, the name of the function can give us a hint about what the function is doing\nArguments\nArguments can be either used to pass data to the function or to change the behaviour of the function. Moreover, you can set default values to the function. If arguments have default values, they do not have to be specified (specifiying means that we have to fill this argument):\n\n# Should NAs be removed or not\naverage = function(x, remove_na) {\n  if(!remove_na) {\n    average = sum(x)/length(x)\n  } else {\n    average = sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)/length(x[complete.cases(x)])\n  }\n  return(average)\n}\n\nvalues = c(5, 4, 3, NA, 5, 2)\n\n# no default option for remove_na, we have to specify it!\naverage(values, remove_na = TRUE)\n## [1] 3.8\n\n# In this case, it is better to set a default option for remova_na:\naverage = function(x, remove_na = TRUE) {\n  if(!remove_na) {\n    average = sum(x)/length(x)\n  } else {\n    average = sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)/length(x[complete.cases(x)])\n  }\n  return(average)\n}\n\naverage(values)\n## [1] 3.8\n\n\n\nif(condition) {  } else { } the if/else statements runs code if a certain condition is true or not. If the condition is true, the first code block {  } is run, if it is false, the second (after the else) is run:\n\nvalues = 1:5\nif(length(values) == 5) {\n  print(\"This vector has length 5\")\n} else {\n  print(\"This vector has not length 5\")\n}\n## [1] \"This vector has length 5\"\n\nArguments are matched by the name or, if names are not specified, by the order:\nfunc(x1, x2, x3) will be interpreted as func(arg1 = x1, arg2 = x2, arg3 = x3)\nBut be careful, if you are unsure about the correct order, you should pass them by their name (func(arg1 = x1, arg2 = x2, arg3 = x3))\n\n\nLoops\nLoops are another important code structure. Example: We want to go over all values of a vector, calculate the square root of it, and overwrite the old value with the new value:\n\nvalues = c(20, 33, 25, 16)\nvalues[1] = sqrt(values[1])\nvalues[2] = sqrt(values[2])\nvalues[3] = sqrt(values[3])\nvalues[4] = sqrt(values[4])\n\nNow what should we do if we have thousands of observations? Loops are the solution! We can use them to automatically “run” a specific vector and then do something with it (well it sounds cryptic but it is actually quite easy):\n\nfor(i in 1:4) { # i in 1:4 means that i should be 1, 2, 3, and 4\n  print(i)\n}\n## [1] 1\n## [1] 2\n## [1] 3\n## [1] 4\n\n# Let's use it to automatize the previous computation:\nfor(i in 1:4) {\n  values[i] = sqrt(values[i])\n}\nvalues\n## [1] 2.114743 2.396782 2.236068 2.000000\n\n# Even better: do not hardcode the length of the vector:\nfor(i in 1:length(values)) {\n  values[i] = sqrt(values[i])\n}\nvalues\n## [1] 1.454215 1.548154 1.495349 1.414214\n\nOur code will now always work, even if we change the length of the values variable!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus Question\n\n\n\nWrite functions for:\n\nCalculate the sum for all values in a matrix given by (we want to write our own implementation of the internal sum(...) function):\n\nmy_matrix = matrix(1:200, 20, 10)\n\nUse the internal sum(...) function to check whether your function is correct!\nExtend the function with arguments that specify that the sum should be calculate over rows, columns, or both (if we calculate the sum over rows or columns, then a vector with n sums for n rows or n columns should be returned).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsum_matrix function\n\n\n\nsum_matrix = function(X) {\n\n  n_row = nrow(X)\n  n_col = ncol(X)\n  result = 0\n  for(i in 1:n_row) {\n    for(j in 1:n_col) {\n      result = result + X[i,j]\n    }\n  }\n  return(result)\n}\n\n\nsum_matrix_extended function\n\n\n  sum_matrix_extended = function(X, which = \"both\") {\n  if(which == \"both\") {\n    result = sum_matrix(X)\n  } else if(which == \"row\") {\n    result = apply(X, 1, sum)\n  } else if(which == \"row\") {\n    result = apply(X, 2, sum)\n  }\n  return(result)\n}\n\nThe apply(...) function can be used to automatically loop over rows (MARGIN=1) or columns (MARGIN=2) and apply a function on each element (rows or columns) which can be specified via apply(data, MARGIN = 1, FUN = sum)"

We want to look at the relationship of the variables “abundance”, “distance” and “grazing”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\nFirst, answer the following questions?:\n\nWhat is the most reasonable research question regarding these variables?\n\n\n How is grazing influenced by distance / abundance? How is distance influenced by grazing / abundance? How is abundance influenced by distance / grazing?\n\n\nWhat is the response variable?\n\n\n abundance distance grazing\n\n\nWhat is the predictor variable?\n\n\n either grazing or distance either abundance or distance either abundance or grazing\n\nThen, perform the following tasks:\n\nFit a simple linear regression relating the response variable to the categorical predictor (that is the one with five levels, make sure that it is indeed a factor using as.factor())\nApply an ANOVA to your model.\n\nYou may need the following functions:\n\nlm()\nsummary()\nanova()\n\nUse your results to chose the correct statement(s):\nYou have now fitted a simple linear regression with a categorical predictor and analyzed it.

We can see in the regression table that the difference between grazing intensity 3 and 4 is significant. The non-significant p-value for grazing intensity 2 indicates that the data are compatible with the null hypothesis “H0: the bird abundance at grazing intensity 2 is on average 0.” The confidence interval for the estimate of the intercept is the smallest. The difference between grazing intensity 1 and 3 is significant. Grazing intensity in general has a highly significant effect (&lt; 0.001) on bird abundance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate of bird abundance for grazing intensity 1 is 28.623. CORRECT: When the predictor is a factor, the intercept equals the first factor level (by default, this follows an alphabetical order).\nWe can see in the regression table that the difference between grazing intensity 3 and 4 is significant. WRONG: Comparisons are always related to the intercept, i.e. to the first factor level. For comparisons among other factor levels we need post-hoc tests.\nThe non-significant p-value for grazing intensity 2 indicates that the data are compatible with the null hypothesis “H0: the bird abundance at grazing intensity 2 is on average 0.” WRONG: Comparisons are always related to the intercept, i.e. to the first factor level.

Approach: First, create a new object consisting of the table of the variable of interest. Then use this object for plotting. Changing plot elements: Have a look at the help of the plotting-function to find out how to change the y- and x-axis labels. What do you notice on the y-axis? You can change the limits of the y-axis using “ylim = c(from, to)” as an argument in the plotting function.\n\nHints for plot 2\nWhat kind of plot can you see here? How many variables does it show? To plot this you need to create a contingency table with the variables of interest. Changing plot elements: You can name the variables in your contingency table (e.g. name = variable, othername = othervariable). The name you assign to your table will be used as the title in the plot.\n\n\n\nClick here to see the solution\n\nPlot 1\n\ncounts &lt;- table(dat$Improved)  # create a table which gives you counts of the three categories in the \"Improved\" variable\n\nbarplot(counts,            # create a barplot of your table\n        ylim = c(0,50),    # change the limits of your y axis: starting from zero to 50\n        xlab = \"Improved\",  # add a label to your x axis\n        ylab = \"Frequency\")  # add a label to your y axis\n\n\n\n\nPlot 2\n\nRatios &lt;- table(Improved = dat$Improved, Treatment = dat$Treatment)  # create a table with the assigned name \"ratios\", give the name \"Improved\" to the first variable which is the variable Improved from the data set Arthritis, give the name \"Treatment\" to the second variable which is the variable Treatment from the data set Arthritis\nplot(Ratios)  # create a plot of the table \"ratios\"\n\n\n\n\nTo view the tables with the names “counts” and “Ratios” you can simply execute their names:\n\ncounts\n## \n##   None   Some Marked \n##     42     14     28\nRatios\n##         Treatment\n## Improved Placebo Treated\n##   None        29      13\n##   Some         7       7\n##   Marked       7      21\n\nCould you already draw conclusions from this plot? No, because this is only a descriptive plot. You can say that a large proportion of the patients that got a placebo treatment did not improve while a large proportion of the patients that got the new treatment improved markedly. However, this could also be the result of random variation and sampling. We need inferential statistics to make conclusions about the effectiveness of the treatment."

This is not stored at CRAN (the official platform for R packages, but at github where we host our own code collections). If you haven’t done this yet, use the code below to install the package (note that you also need the “devtools” package to do this. Again, to load it and make the data set accessible, execute the function library(EcoData). To view the data set you can use the View() function again.\nYou can also get more explanations on the data set via the help.\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\nlibrary(devtools)\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"TheoreticalEcology/EcoData\", dependencies = T, build_vignettes = T)\nlibrary(EcoData)\nView(birdabundance)\n\nThe dataset has been assessed by scientists in Australia who counted birds in forest fragments and looked for drivers that influence these bird abundances, e.g. the size of a forest fragment and the distance to the next fragment. We want to see how these distances vary. A histogram is the standard figure to depict one numerical variable, such as for example distance measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nYour task is now to reconstruct the following histogram including the labels, colors and lines using the functions:\n\nhist() to create a histogram\nabline() to add (vertical) lines to your histogram\n\nThink about what the histogram tells you about the distances between each forest fragment and the next forest fragment. What do the red and purple lines represent? Which site was the furthest away from forest fragments?\n\n\n\n\n\nHints for plotting\nChange the color (look at the help to see how). You can also try other colors, e.g. your favorite color (you can find all available colors with the function colors()). Change the bar widths (breaks). Play around to see how they change. When changing the bar widths, what do you notice on the y-axis? You can change the y-axis limits using “ylim” (see examples for hist(), second last line). Change the title and the x-axis name of your histogram using the arguments “main” and “xlab”.\nTo add the lines, try the abline() function with the argument “v = 90” and look what happens. To remove the line, you have to execute the code producing your histogram again. Remember that abline() is a low level plotting function, which means it only adds an element to an existing plot! Instead of calculating the depicted values with a function and then pasting the values into your abline function, you can also directly use the function in abline().\nSee an example on the right.\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see the solution\n\nYou can plot the histogram like this:\n\nhist(birdabundance$DIST,  # plot a histogram of the varriable distance from the data set birdabundance\n     breaks = 20,  # change bar widths, here we make them smaller\n     col = \"blue\",  # change color to blue\n     ylim = c(0,20),  # change the range of the y axis to from 0 to 20\n     main = \"Distance distribution\",  # change title of the plot\n     xlab = \"Distance to the next forest fragment\")  # change x axis name\nabline(v = mean(birdabundance$DIST), col = \"red\")  # add a vertical line with an x value equal to the mean of the variable distance\nabline(v = median(birdabundance$DIST), col = \"purple\")  # add a vertical line with an x value equal to the median of the variable distance\n\n\n\n\nWhat do the red and purple lines represent?\nThe red line represents the mean distance between forest fragments, while the purple line represents the median.\nWhich site was the furthest away from forest fragments?\n\n# Extract the line in which the variable DIST takes its maximum\nbirdabundance[which.max(birdabundance$DIST),]\n##    Site ABUND AREA DIST LDIST YR.ISOL GRAZE ALT\n## 48   48  39.6   49 1427  1557    1972     1 180\n\nThe site number 48 was the furthest away.\n\n\n\n\nhist(airquality$Temp)\nabline(v = 90, col = \"blue\")\nabline(v = median(airquality$Temp), col = \"red\")"

    "text": "Scatterplot\nAs you’ve learned by now, plot() can create different types of plots depending on the type of the input data. It creates a scatterplot when plotting two numerical variables. Now we are interested to see how the abundance of birds is affected by the distance to the next forest fragment, and if there is another variable that is important for this relationship (visualized here by the color of the points).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nAgain, your task is to reconstruct the following plot using the following functions:\n\nplot()\n(str())\n(summary())\n\nWhat do you notice about the distribution of the colors along bird abundance?\nWhat is the mean bird abundance per color?\n\n\n\n\n\nHints for plotting:\nWhat is plotted on the x-axis, what on the y-axis?\nThere are two different ways to write the plot function. One is to stick with the “Usage” in the help of the plot function (giving coordinates along the x-axis as the first attribute and those along the y-axis as the second attribute). The other way is to write the relationship between x and y as a formula that is: y~x, data = dataset Use google to find out how you can change the point shapes in your plot.\nLook at the dataset to find out which variable is indicated by the color of the points in the plot. Hint: It is a variable indicating 5 intensity levels. To change the color, include the attribute “col” in your plot function and set it equal to the variable.\nTo get a color gradient you can create a function with the following code. Apply it before producing your plot and use the created function rbPal() as the color in the plot.\n\n# Palettes can be created with a function for the grDevices package\ninstall.packages(\"grDevices\")\nlibrary(grDevices)\n\n# Create a function to generate a continuous color palette from red to blue\nrbPal &lt;- colorRampPalette(c('red','blue'))\n\n# Example for color in a plot\nplot(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = airquality, \n     col = rbPal(12)[Month]) # you can use any number, here it's 12 because we have 12 months\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see the solution\n\nYou can either create a scatterplot of two numerical variables like this:\n\n#Create a function to generate a continuous color palette from red to blue\nrbPal &lt;- colorRampPalette(c('red','blue')) # rpPal for red to blue palette\n\nplot(birdabundance$DIST, birdabundance$ABUND,  # create a plot of the variables DIST against ABUND from the data set birdabundance\n     ylab = \"Distance (m)\",  # add the label \"Distance\" to the y axis\n     xlab = \"Bird abundance\",  # add the label \"Bird abundance\" to the x axis\n     col = rbPal(5)[birdabundance$GRAZE],  # color the data points according to their category in the variable GRAZE from the data set birdabundance\n     pch = 17) # change the point shape\n\n\n\n\nOr like this:\n\nplot(ABUND ~ DIST, data = birdabundance,  # create a plot of the variables DIST against ABUND from the data set birdabundance\n     xlab = \"Distance (m)\",  # add the label \"Distance\" to the x axis\n     ylab = \"Bird abundance\",  # add the label \"Bird abundance\" to the y axis\n     col = rbPal(5)[GRAZE],  # color the data points according to their category in the variable GRAZE as a gradient\n     pch = 17) # change the point shape\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage of the second version is that it uses the structure of “response variable (y) explained by (~) explanatory variable (x)”. Also, you tell the plot function which data set to use once and it will automatically draw the variables from there, while in the first version you name the data set and the respective variable each time (even for the color).\nWhat do you notice about the distribution of the colors along bird abundance?\nYou can see that the blue data points are only at the low abundances, whereas the red data points are rather at the higher abundances. Purple data points are throughout all abundances. There thus seems to be a correlation between the grazing classes and bird abundances.\nWhat is the mean bird abundance per color / level of grazing intensity?\n\n# Option 1: Using tidyverse / dplyr as shown at the end of section 2.0.1 Summary statistics:\nlibrary(dplyr)\n## \n## Attaching package: 'dplyr'\n## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n## \n##     filter, lag\n## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n## \n##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\nbird_grouped &lt;- birdabundance %&gt;% # define dataset to be summarized\n  group_by(GRAZE) %&gt;% # define grouping factor\n  summarise(mean.abund = mean(ABUND)) # summarize by taking the mean of abundance\n\n# Option 2: Using base R and formula notation:\nbird_grouped &lt;- aggregate(ABUND~GRAZE, data = birdabundance, FUN = mean)\n\nbird_grouped\n##   GRAZE     ABUND\n## 1     1 28.623077\n## 2     2 21.950000\n## 3     3 21.286667\n## 4     4 20.571429\n## 5     5  6.292308"

What is the Notch?:\nBox plots by themselves cannot be used to make conclusions about significant differences. Tomorrow we will learn that we have two statistics for hypothesis testing, the effects (e.g., means) and the uncertainties of those effects/estimates. The box plot shows the medians, which we could theoretically use for testing. However, the boxplot doesn’t report the uncertainty of the reports. The uncertainty of the estimate is not the width/height of the box, it is just the distribution of the variable, for example:\n\nset.seed(2)\nvar1 = rnorm(50)\nvar2 = rnorm(10000)\nsd(var1)/sqrt(50)\n## [1] 0.1597612\nsd(var2)/sqrt(10000)\n## [1] 0.009994205\ndf = data.frame(values = c(var1, var2), group = as.factor(c(rep(\"var1\", 50), rep(\"var2\", 10000))))\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,1))\nboxplot(values~group, data = df, notch = TRUE)\ntext(1, 4.5,xpd = NA, labels = paste0(\"N = 50, standard error = \", round(sd(var1)/sqrt(50), 4)))\ntext(2, 4.5,xpd = NA, labels = paste0(\"N = 10000, standard error = \", round(sd(var1)/sqrt(10000), 4)))\n\n\n\n\nThe standard error changes with the number of observations (more on this tomorrow), while the distribution (the box) remains relatively stable!\nThe notch is the confidence interval of the median, so 2*the standard error of the median. We can roughly say that there is a significant difference when the confidence intervals overlap!"

We will properly test such relationships later in the course. In the scatter plot we have seen this weak positive correlation already. The second correlation (abundance to grazing) tells us that there is a stronger negative correlation between abundance and grazing. We have already seen a pattern of the color of the data points along bird abundances (red towards higher, blue towards lower abundances). The third correlation (grazing to distance) tells us that there is a small negative correlation between the two variables.

The next decision you have to make is whether you can use a parametric test or not. Apply the Shapiro-Wilk test to check if the data are normally distributed.

Remember: you have to test two things for the groups (for this exercise it is enough if you test the groups “casein” and “horsebean” only).\n\n We have no indication to assume that the data is not-normally distributed or that the variances are different. We should use a Kruskal-Wallis test. The Shapiro-Wilk test of normality and the test for equal variances are not signficant. We cannot use an ANOVA. We have no indication to assume that the data is not-normally distributed or that the variances are different. We can use an ANOVA. Boxplot\n\n\n\nClick here to see the solution\n\nThe two requirements for applying an ANOVA are 1) the data in each group are normally distributed, and 2) the variances of the different groups are equal. For 1) we again use a Shapiro-Wilk test. For 2) we can use the function var.test() or for all feed types the function bartlett.test().

How would you describe the result in a thesis or publication?\n\n The feed type significantly influences the chicken weight (ANOVA, p = 5.94e-10).

Boxplot\n\n\n\nClick here to see the solution\n\nH0 of the ANOVA is that feed has no influence on the chicken weight. As p &lt; 0.05, we reject H0.

Which of the tests has a higher power?\n\n ANOVA The alternative test Both have the same power The p-value doesn't help us to identify the power.\n\n\n\nClick here to see the solution\n\nThe non-parametric alternative of an ANOVA is the Kruskal-Wallis test, which should be applied if the data is not normally distributed. In this example, the test comes to the same conclusion: H0 is rejected, the feed type has a significant effect on the chicken weight. The p-value, however, is not as small as in the ANOVA. The reason for this is that non-parametric tests have a lower power than parametric ones as they only use the ranks of the data. Therefore, the ANOVA is preferred over the non-parametric alternative in case its assumptions are fulfilled.\n\nkruskal.test(chickwts$weight, chickwts$feed)\n## \n##  Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n## \n## data:  chickwts$weight and chickwts$feed\n## Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 37.343, df = 5, p-value = 5.113e-07\n\nThe p-value in the Kruskal-Wallis test is not as small as in the ANOVA.
