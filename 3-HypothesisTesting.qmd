# Part 3
# Hypothesis testing




# Simulation of p-values -------------------------------------------------
# Imagine we do an experiment with two groups, one treatment and one control group
# Test outcomes are binary (e.g. whether individuals are cured)

# 1. We need a test statistic
# for example: number cured in control minus number cured in treatment: control - treatment

# 2. We need the distribution of this test statistic under the null

# Let's create a true world without effect:
PperGroup = 50 # number of replicates (e.g., persons per treatment group)
pC = 0.5 #probability of being cured in control group
pT = 0.5 #probability of being cured in treatment group; = same because we want to use these to get the distribution of the test statistic we define below when H0 is true (no effect)

set.seed(123)
# Let's draw a sample from this world without effect
control = rbinom(n = 1, size = PperGroup, prob = pC)
treat = rbinom(n = 1, size = PperGroup, prob = pT)
#calculate the test statistic: 
control - treat
#and plot
barplot(c(control, treat), ylim = c(0, 50))

# Now, let's do this very often to get the distribution under H0
testStatistic = rep(NA, 100000) 
for (i in 1:100000) {
  control = rbinom(n = 1, size = PperGroup, prob = pC)
  treat = rbinom(n = 1, size = PperGroup, prob = pT)
  testStatistic[i] = control - treat # test statistic 
}
hist(testStatistic, breaks = 50)

# okay, we have our test statistic + the frequency distribution of our statistic 
# if the H0 = true
# now we make an experiment:
# assume that we observed the following data: C = 30 T = 23
testStatisticData = 30 - 23
abline(v = testStatisticData, col = "red")

mean(testStatistic > testStatisticData) #compare each value in our testStatistic 
#distribution with the observed value and calculate proportion of TRUE values 
#(where testStatistic > testStatisticData)


# how you would do this correctly
prop.test(c(30, 23), c(PperGroup, PperGroup))
# other test statistic with known distribution
# Pearson's chi-squared test statistic
# no need to simulate

```


The following three sections provide an overview over the most important hypothesis tests, a guideline to select an appropriate test (see decision tree) and the necessary code to apply these tests in R. It is not necessary to read and understand every detail. These explanations are also meant as an advice if you want to select an appropriate hypothesis test after the course. Note that some of the examples use simulated data instead of real observation (all functions that start with r=random, e.g. rnorm() or runif()). Simulated data is useful, because then we know the true distribution and its true mean.

In the last section at the end of this file, you find exercises that you should solve using the explanations above. It may be helpful to use the table of content and/or the search option to find the respective example in the explanations.

## Comparison of mean of two or more groups

Many tests aim at showing that variables are significantly different between groups, i.e. have different means/medians. In all these tests, H0 is that there is no difference between the groups. The following decision tree helps to select the appropriate test.


![Fig. 1. Decision tree for the comparison of two groups](Decision tree.jpg)

**Remark 1**: Tests for 2 groups also work for one group only. Then they test whether the mean is equal to 0.

**Remark 2**: Paired / unpaired: this means that observations in the groups are linked to each other. An example for unpaired data is a typical experiment with 10 observations in the control group and 10 observations in the treatment group. An example for paired data is when the same individuals were exposed to the treatment and to the control. The observations of each individual would belong together (pairs).

**Remark 3**: Parametric: assumption of normal distribution. Non-parametric = no assumption for the distribution.

**Remark 4**: Blue text: If a test for more than two groups is significant, post-hoc tests are carried out in a second step. These check all possible comparisons of groups for significant differences by adjusting p-values for multiple testing. 



### Tests for 2 groups

#### t-Test 

The t-test can draw conclusions about the mean(s) of 1 or 2 normally-distributed groups.

```{r}
## Classical example: Student's sleep data
plot(extra ~ group, data = sleep)
```

**Be aware**: The line in the box plot does not show the mean but the median.

```{r}
## Formula interface
t.test(extra ~ group, data = sleep)
```
This output tells us, that the difference in means between the 2 groups is not significant(p-value ≥ 0.05, specifically: p-value = 0.07939), provided that our significance level is 0.05.  
The underlying Null-hypothesis is that the true difference in means is equal to 0. In the last two lines of the output you can see the means of the respective groups. Even though the means seem to be quite different, the difference is not significant, this could be due to the small sample size of only 10 students per group.  

Let's look at different settings of the t-test:


##### t-test, H0: one group, mean = 0

The Null-hypothesis here is that the mean of the observed group is equal to 0.
```{r}
x = rnorm(20, mean = 2)
t.test(x)
```
p-value < 0.05 means we can reject the Null-hypothesis, i.e. the mean of the observed group is significantly different from 0.

##### t-test, H0: two groups, equal means, equal variances
The Null-hypothesis here is that the two observed groups have the same mean and the same variance (specified by the argument *var.equal = T*).
```{r}
x1 = rnorm(20, mean = 2)
x2 = rnorm(20, mean = 3)
t.test(x1,x2, var.equal = T)
```

##### t-test, H0: two groups, equal means, variable variance 
The Null-hypothesis here is that the two observed groups have the same mean and variable variances (the default setting of the argument *var.equal = F*).
```{r}
x1 = rnorm(20, mean = 2, sd = 1)
x2 = rnorm(20, mean = 3, sd = 2)
t.test(x1,x2)
```

##### t-test, H0: two groups, equal means, variance can be different (can also set to equal)
The Null-hypothesis here is that the two groups are paired observations (e.g. group 1 before treatment and group 2 after treatment) have the same mean and variable variance (specified by the argument *var.equal = F*, which is also the default setting).
```{r}
x1 = rnorm(20, mean = 2)
x2 = rnorm(20, mean = 3)
t.test(x1,x2, paired = T, var.equal = F)
```


#### Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Mann-Whitney U Test

In R, there is only one function for both tests together: wilcox.test(). The Wilcoxon rank sum test with (paired = F) is classically called Mann-Whitney U test.


##### Mann-Whitney U Test

```{r}
x1 = rnorm(20, mean = 2)
x2 = rlnorm(20, mean = 3)

wilcox.test(x1, x2)

```

##### Wilcoxon signed rank test

```{r}
x1 = rnorm(20, mean = 2)
x2 = rlnorm(20, mean = 3)

wilcox.test(x1, x2, paired = T)

```


### Tests for > 2 groups

#### Anova, unpaired

H0 >2 groups, normal distribution, equal variance, equal means, unpaired

```{r}
x = aov(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)
summary(x)
```

An ANOVA only tests, if there is a difference, but not between which groups. To perform pairwise comparisons, you can use post-hoc tests. Common for ANOVA results is

```{r}
TukeyHSD(x)
```

Alternatively, you can also perform several tests each comparing two groups and then correct for multiple testing. This is what we did before.

Pairwise comparisons are often visualized using different letters to significantly different groups: 

```{r, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("multcomp")
library(multcomp)
tuk = glht(x, linfct = mcp(group = "Tukey")) #performs Tukey pairwise comparisons
tuc.cld = cld(tuk) # assigns different letters to significantly different groups

old.par = par(mai = c(1, 1, 1.25, 1), no.readonly = T)
plot(tuc.cld) # draws boxplot + letters from cld function
par(old.par)
```

#### Anova, paired

aov is not good in doing repeated = paired ANOVA. In simple cases, you can just subtract the paired groups. In general, you should use so-called mixed models! 

#### Kruskal-Wallis

Non-parametric test for differences in the mean of  >2 groups, unpaired

```{r}
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
kruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```

#### Friedmann Test

Non-parametric test for differences in the mean of  >2 groups, paired.


```{r}
wb <- aggregate(warpbreaks$breaks,
                by = list(w = warpbreaks$wool,
                          t = warpbreaks$tension),
                FUN = mean)
#wb
friedman.test(wb$x, wb$w, wb$t)
# Alternative: friedman.test(x ~ w | t, data = wb)
# Note that x is the response, w is the group, and t are the blocks that are paired
```


## Comparison of variances

H0 in variance tests is always that the variances are equal.

### F-Test for two normally-distributed samples

```{r}
x <- rnorm(50, mean = 0, sd = 2)
y <- rnorm(30, mean = 1, sd = 1)
var.test(x, y)                  # Do x and y have the same variance? - Significantly different
```

### Bartlett test for more than two normally-distributed samples

```{r}
x <- rnorm(50, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y <- rnorm(30, mean = 1, sd = 1)
z <- rnorm(30, mean = 1, sd = 1)
bartlett.test(list(x, y, z))                # Do x, y and z have the same variance? - Not sigificantly different
```

## Comparison of discrete proportions

Discrete proportions are typically analyzed assuming the binomial model (k/n with probability p)

### Exact Binomial Test 

H0 is that the data are binomially distributed with a fixed probability p.

```{r}
## Conover (1971), p. 97f.
## Under (the assumption of) simple Mendelian inheritance, a cross
##  between plants of two particular genotypes produces progeny 1/4 of
##  which are "dwarf" and 3/4 of which are "giant", respectively.
##  In an experiment to determine if this assumption is reasonable, a
##  cross results in progeny having 243 dwarf and 682 giant plants.
##  If "giant" is taken as success, the null hypothesis is that p =
##  3/4 and the alternative that p != 3/4.
binom.test(c(682, 243), p = 3/4)
binom.test(682, 682 + 243, p = 3/4)   # The same.
## => Data are in agreement with H0
```

### Test of Equal or Given Proportions 

based on Chi-squared-test, H0 is that the data in two groups are binomially distributed with the same probability p.

```{r}
## Data from Fleiss (1981), p. 139.
## H0: The null hypothesis is that the four populations from which
##     the patients were drawn have the same true proportion of smokers.
## A:  The alternative is that this proportion is different in at
##     least one of the populations.
smokers  <- c( 83, 90, 129, 70 )
patients <- c( 86, 93, 136, 82 )
prop.test(smokers, patients)
##  => Data are not in agreement with H0
```

### Contingency tables

Chi-squared-test for count data, H0 is that the joint distribution of the cell counts in a 2-dimensional contingency table is the product of the row and column marginals

```{r}
## From Agresti(2007) p.39
M <- as.table(rbind(c(762, 327, 468), c(484, 239, 477)))
dimnames(M) <- list(gender = c("F", "M"),
                    party = c("Democrat","Independent", "Republican"))
chisq.test(M)
```



## Distribution tests

Often we are interested in the distribution of a variable. This can be tested with distribution tests. All these tests are defined as follows: H0 is that the data follow a specific distribution. So in case H0 is rejected, the data significantly deviates from the specified distribution.

Often, we want to know whether a variable is normally distributed because this is an important assumption for parametric hypothesis tests. But data can follow many other distributions:

![Fig. 2. Decision tree for distributions](distributions.png)

### Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test

Because many tests require normal distribution, this is the test needed most often.

```{r}
shapiro.test(rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 3))
```



###  Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test 

For everything else, the KS test can be used. It compares two different distributions, or a distribution against a reference. 


```{r}
x <- rnorm(50)
y <- runif(30)
# Do x and y come from the same distribution?
ks.test(x, y)

# Does x come from a shifted gamma distribution with shape 3 and rate 2?
ks.test(x+2, "pgamma", 3, 2) # two-sided, exact
ks.test(x+2, "pgamma", 3, 2, exact = FALSE)
ks.test(x+2, "pgamma", 3, 2, alternative = "gr")
```

For an overview on distribution see here: http://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/old/5101/rlook.html

## Other tests

### Correlation

A test for the significance of a correlation:

```{r}
cor.test(airquality$Ozone, airquality$Wind)
```
Interpretation: Ozone and Wind are significantly negatively correlated with a p-value < 0.05 and a correlation coefficient of -0.6015465.


### Mantel test 

The Mantel test compares two distance matrices

```{r message=FALSE}
library(vegan)
## Is vegetation related to environment?
data(varespec)
data(varechem)
veg.dist <- vegdist(varespec) # Bray-Curtis
env.dist <- vegdist(scale(varechem), "euclid")
mantel(veg.dist, env.dist)
mantel(veg.dist, env.dist, method="spear")
```


## Exercises


### Streams

The dataset 'streams' contains water measurements taken at different location along 16 rivers: 'up' and 'down' are water quality measurements of the same river taken before and after a water treatment filter, respectively. We want to find out if this water filter is effective. Use the decision tree to identify the appropriate test for this situation.

```{r}
dat = read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biometry/APES/master/Data/Simone/streams.txt", header = T)
```

Visualize and analyze the data and answer the following questions at **elearning-extern**.

1. For identifying an appropriate test for the effect of the water treatment filter, what are your first two choices in the decision tree?
2. The next decision you have to make is whether you can use a parametric test or not. Apply the Shapiro-Wilk test to check if the data are normally distributed. Are the tests significant and what does that tell you?
3. Which test is appropriate for evaluating the effect of the filter?
4. Does the filter influence the water quality? (The warnings are related to identical values, i.e. ties, and zero differences; we ignore these here)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
#### Solution

You can visualize the data as follows:

```{r}
dat = read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biometry/APES/master/Data/Simone/streams.txt", header = T)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
boxplot(dat)
matplot(t(dat), type = "l") # each line is one river, left is down and right is upstream
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

1. The number of groups to compare is **two**, up versus down stream. The observations are **paired** because the water tested up and down stream of the filter is not independent from each other, i.e. the "same" water is measured twice!
2. The Shapiro-Wilk test is significant (p < 0.05) for down stream data, i.e. we reject H0 (the data is normally distributed). Thus, the data significantly deviate from a normal distribution. The test is not significant for upstream data; the data does not significantly deviate from a normal distribution.

```{r}
shapiro.test(dat$down)
shapiro.test(dat$up)
```

3. We select a **Wilcoxon signed rank test** that is appropriate to compare not-normal, paired observations in two groups. 
4. H0 of the Wilcoxon signed rank test is that the location shift between the two groups equals zero, i.e. the difference between the pairs follows a symmetric distribution around zero. As p < 0.05, we can reject H0. The filter significantly influences water quality. (In case of ties also see the function wilcox.test() in the package coin for exact, asymptotic and Monte Carlo conditional p-values)

```{r}
wilcox.test(dat$down, dat$up, paired = T)
```


:::

### Chicken

The 'chickwts' experiment was carried out to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens. We are interested in two questions: Does the feed type influence the chickens weight at all? Which feed types result in significantly different chicken weights?

```{r}
dat = chickwts
```

Analyze the data and answer the following questions at **elearning-extern**.

1. Visualize the data. What is an appropriate plot for this kind of data?
2. Can you apply an ANOVA to this data? What are the assumptions for an ANOVA? Remember: you have to test two things for the groups (for this exercise it is enough if you test the groups "casein" and "horsebean" only).
3. Apply an ANOVA or the non-parametric test. How would you describe the result in a thesis or publication?
4. Also apply the alternative test and compare p-values. Which of the tests has a higher power? 
5. Use the result of the ANOVA to carry out a post-hoc test. How many of the pairwise comparisons indicate significant differences between the groups?
6. Which conclusion about the feed types 'meatmeal' and 'casein' is correct?


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
#### Solution

1. An appropriate visualization for one numeric and one categorial variable is a **boxplot**. Using 'notch = T' in the function boxplot(), adds confidence interval for the median (the warning here indicates that we are not very confident in the estimates of the medians as the number of observations is rather small, you can see at the notches that go beyond the boxes).

```{r}
dat = chickwts
boxplot(weight ~ feed, data = dat)
boxplot(weight ~ feed, data = dat, notch = T)
```

2. The two requirements for applying an ANOVA are 1) the data in each group are normally distributed, and 2) the variances of the different groups are equal. For 1) we again use a Shapiro-Wilk test. For 2) we can use the function var.test() or for all feed types the function bartlett.test(). All tests are not significant, and we thus have no indication to assume that the data is not-normally distributed or that the variances are different. We can use an ANOVA.

```{r}
# get data of each group
casein = dat$weight[dat$feed == "casein"]
horsebean = dat$weight[dat$feed == "horsebean"]

shapiro.test(casein)
shapiro.test(horsebean)
# H0 normally distributed
# not rejected, normality assumption is okay

var.test(casein, horsebean)
# H0 ratio of variances is 1 = groups have the same variance
# not rejected, same variances is okay


### Extra: testing the assumptions for all groups:

# Normality test using the dplyr package
library(dplyr)
dat %>% 
  group_by(feed) %>% 
  summarise(p = shapiro.test(weight)$p)

# Bartlett test for equal variances
bartlett.test(weight ~ feed, dat)

```

3. H0 of the ANOVA is that feed has no influence on the chicken weight. As p < 0.05, we reject H0. In the result section, we would write something like: "The feed type significantly influenced the chicken weight (ANOVA, p = 5.94e-10)."

```{r}
fit = aov(weight ~ feed, data = dat)
summary(fit)
```

4. The non-parametric alternative of an ANOVA is the Kruskal-Wallis test, which should be applied if the data is not normally distributed. In this example, the test comes to the same conclusion: H0 is rejected, the feed type has a significant effect on the chicken weight. The p-value, however, is not as small as in the ANOVA. The reason for this is that non-parametric tests have a lower power than parametric ones as they only use the ranks of the data. Therefore, the ANOVA is preferred over the non-parametric alternative in case its assumptions are fulfilled. 

```{r}
kruskal.test(chickwts$weight, chickwts$feed)
```

5. From the 15 comparisons among feed types, 8 are significantly different. 

```{r}
TukeyHSD(fit)
```

6. The experiment did not reveal a significant weight difference between the feed types 'meatmeal' and 'casein'. Remember that we cannot prove or accept H0; we can only reject it.

### Titanic

The dataset 'titanic' from the EcoData package (not to confuse with the dataset 'Titanic') provides information on individual passengers of the Titanic. 

```{r echo=TRUE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,results='hide'}
library(EcoData) #or: load("EcoData.Rdata"), if you had problems with installing the package
dat = titanic
```

Answer the following questions at **elearning-extern**.

1. We are interested in first and second class differences only. Reduce the dataset to these classes only. How can you do this in R?
2. Does the survival rate between the first and second class differ? Hint: you can apply the test to a contigency table of passenger class versus survived, i.e. `table(dat$pclass, dat$survived)`.
3. Is the variable passenger age normally distributed?
4. Is the variable Body Identification Number (body) uniformly distributed? 
5. Is the correlation between fare and age significant?


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
#### Solution

1. The dataset can be reduced in different ways. All three options result in a dataset with class 1 and 2 only. 

```{r echo=TRUE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,results='hide'}
library(EcoData)
dat = titanic

dat = dat[dat$pclass == 1 | dat$pclass == 2, ]
dat = dat[dat$pclass %in% 1:2, ] # the same
dat = dat[dat$pclass != 3, ] # the same
```

2. We use the test of equal proportions here. H0, proportions in the two groups are equal, is rejected. The survival probability in class 1 and class 2 is significantly different. Note that the estimated proportions are for mortality not for survival because 0=died is in the first column of the table. Thus it is considered the "success" in the prop.test().

```{r}
table(dat$pclass, dat$survived)
prop.test(table(dat$pclass, dat$survived))
```

3. The distribution of passenger age significantly differs from normal.

```{r}
hist(dat$age, breaks = 20)
shapiro.test(dat$age)
```


4. The distribution of body significantly differs from uniform.

```{r}
hist(dat$body, breaks = 20)
ks.test(dat$body, "punif")
```

5. The correlation between fare and age is non-significant. You can also plot the data using the scatter.smooth function.

```{r}
cor.test(dat$fare, dat$age)
scatter.smooth(dat$fare, dat$age)
```

### Simulation of Type I and II error

*This is an additional task for those who are fast! Please finish the other parts first and submit your solution in elearning-extern before you continue here!*

Analogously to the previous example of simulating the test statistic, we can also simulate error rates.
Complete the code ...

```{r}
PperGroup = 50
pC = 0.5
pT = 0.5

pvalues = rep(NA, 1000)

for(i in 1:1000){
  control = rbinom(n = 1, size = PperGroup, prob = pC)
  treat = rbinom(n = 1, size = PperGroup, prob = pT)
  #XXXX
}

```


... and answer the following questions for the prop.test in R:

1. How does the distribution of p-values and the number of false positive (Type I error) look like if pC = pT

2. How does the distribution of p-values and the number of true positive (Power) look like if pC != pT, e.g. 0.5, 0.6 

3. How does the distribution of p-values and the number of false positive (Type I error) look like if you modify the for loop in a way that you first look at the data, and then decide if you test for greater or less?

#### Solution

Analogously to our previous example with simulating the test statistic, we can also simulate the error rates.
This is the completed code the different examples:

1. pC = pT

```{r}
PperGroup = 50
pC = 0.5
pT = 0.5

pvalues = rep(NA, 1000)
positives = rep(NA, 1000)

for(i in 1:1000){
  control = rbinom(1, PperGroup, prob = pC )
  treatment = rbinom(1, PperGroup, prob = pT )
  pvalues[i] = prop.test(c(control, treatment), rep(PperGroup, 2))$p.value
  positives[i] = pvalues[i] <= 0.05
}
hist(pvalues)
table(positives)
mean(positives) 

# type I error rate = false positives (if data simulation etc. is performed several times, this should be on average 0.05 (alpha))

```

2. pC != pT with difference 0.1

```{r}
PperGroup = 50
pC = 0.5
pT = 0.6

pvalues = rep(NA, 1000)
positives = rep(NA, 1000)

for(i in 1:1000){
  control = rbinom(1, PperGroup, prob = pC )
  treatment = rbinom(1, PperGroup, prob = pT )
  pvalues[i] = prop.test(c(control, treatment), rep(PperGroup, 2))$p.value
  positives[i] = prop.test(c(control, treatment), rep(PperGroup, 2))$p.value < 0.05
}
hist(pvalues)
table(positives)
mean(pvalues < 0.05) # = power (rate at which effect is detected by the test)
# power = 1- beta > beta = 1-power = typeII error rate
1-mean(pvalues < 0.05)

## Factors increasing power and reducing type II errors:
# - increase sample size
# - larger real effect size (but this is usually fixed by the system)

```

3. You first look at the data, and then decide if you test for greater or less:

```{r}
# ifelse(test,yes,no)
PperGroup = 50
pC = 0.5
pT = 0.5

for(i in 1:1000){
  control = rbinom(1, PperGroup, prob = pC )
  treatment = rbinom(1, PperGroup, prob = pT )
  pvalues[i] = prop.test(c(control, treatment), rep(PperGroup, 2), 
                        alternative= ifelse(mean(control)>mean(treatment),
                                            "greater","less"))$p.value
  positives[i] = prop.test(c(control, treatment), rep(PperGroup, 2),
                     alternative= ifelse(mean(control)>mean(treatment),
                                         "greater","less"))$p.value < 0.05
}
hist(pvalues)
table(positives)
mean(pvalues < 0.05) 
# higher false discovery rate
```
